------------------
Task 0:
find first record:  O(1)
find last record:  O(1)
Complexity in each case will remain O(1) irrespective of the input size

------------------
Task 1:
O(n)
Since there is one for loop involve the execution time will grow with the input file length
------------------
Task 2:
My previous approach was not good as it was O(n^2)
Upon correction the Order reduced to O(n) i.e. from exponential to a linear approach

------------------
Task 3:
Part A: O(n)
Part B: O(n)
This was a simple linear approach with one for loop involved.

------------------
Task 4:
O(n)
My previous approach was also a linear one but it involved multiple operation which could be computationaly expensive
as per reviewer's suggestion I have used the set() approach that has simplified the code both for user and machine
